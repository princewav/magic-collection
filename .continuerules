Please provide concise answers. Don't explain obvious concepts. You can assume that I am very knowledgable about most programming topics.

Whenever you are writing React code, make sure to
- define an interface for your component props
- modularize components into smaller, reusable pieces
- Follow Next.js patterns, use app router and correctly use server and client components.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Use Shadcn UI for components.
- Use TanStack Query (react-query) for frontend data fetching.
- Use React Hook Form for form handling.
- Use Zod for validation.
- Use React Context for state management.
- Follow AirBnB style guide for code formatting.
- Use PascalCase when creating new React files. UserCard, not user-card.
- Use named exports when creating new react components.
- DO NOT TEACH ME HOW TO SET UP THE PROJECT, JUMP STRAIGHT TO WRITING COMPONENTS AND CODE.

Whenever you are specifically asked to generate a commit message, make sure to use lowercase for generating commit messages, don't write description;
use shadcn@... instead of shadcn-ui@... when generating commands to install shadcn components.
