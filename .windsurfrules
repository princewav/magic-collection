## General Principles
- Follow **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**, **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**, **YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)**, and **SOLID** principles.
- Prefer "return early" coding style.

## Commit Message Conventions
- Use **conventional commit messages**.
- Use **lowercase** for commit messages.
- Do **not** include descriptions.
- Example: `fix: button alignment`

## Prohibited Actions
- **Do not explain obvious programming concepts**
- Do not explain simple changes, and if you do make it concise. focus on the code you generate.
- **Do not generate over-engineered solutions** without prior discussion.

## Code of conduct

## React Code Style and Patterns
- Avoid classes and stateful modules where possible.
- Break down components into smaller parts with minimal props to keep complexity low, and compose them together. This will ensure that the styles and functionality are flexible and extensible.
- Follow **Next.js App Router** patterns, correctly using **server and client components**.
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling.
- Use **Shadcn UI** for components.
- Use **React Hook Form** for form handling.
- Use **Zod** for validation.
- Use **React Context** for state management.
- Use **PascalCase** for filenames (e.g., `UserCard.tsx`, not `user-card.tsx`).
- Use **named exports** for components.
- Write functional components instead of class-based ones.
- use pnpm instead of npm when you suggest installing packages

## Shadcn Installation Commands
- Use `shadcn@...`, not `shadcn-ui@...`.
